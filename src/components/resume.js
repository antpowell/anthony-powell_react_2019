					'I am a proud graduate of Texas Southern University, a university that was originally founded to educate students of African-American descent, also known as a HBCU, where I graduated with both B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science. I have worked for two Fortune500 companies, one of which being among the big five tech companies, and operated as a co-founder and lead engineer of a small education technology start-up. I have also tough students of varying ages and school levels, to include university level, the fundamentals of Computer Science and coding. I love everything tech and cool and want to bring as much of that world to underserved communities like the ones I was raised in. I also bring a capacity to accomplish any mission assigned to me, work independently or within a group, and give purpose, direction, and motivation to others thanks to the skills I acquired in my 12+ years serving in the United States Armed Forces.

					'I\'m currently working on my M.S. Computer Science at Texas Southern University where he also was awarded his B.S. Computer Science. During my time at TSU, I was a Graduate Research Assistant, Lead System Engineer, Software Developer, and Team Leader for the Center for Research on Complex Networks Education Outreach Software Development section. Under the guidance of a mentor, Dr. Oscar Criner, I led a team of undergraduate and graduate developers in the development of an attendance management system that was adopted by professors University-wide. My passion for software development, technology, and teaching led to me being the first student from TSU to acquire the Lead position with Google Developer Groups - Houston and co-founding the largest student-run Computer Science organization as an undergraduate, the Mobile Application Development Group. My presentation, "Dynamic Data Analytics for Higher Education", won first place Oral Presenter in Computer Sciences & Information Management at the 2017 Emerging Researchers National Conference in STEM for my research on the relationship between class attendance and successful matriculation through STEM degrees in higher education and the creation of an Attendance Management System to help track and manage attendance at my University.',
